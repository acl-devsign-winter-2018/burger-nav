Lab: Burger Nav
===

We have discussed the [usability pros and cons! of the Hamburger Menu](https://uxplanet.org/basic-patterns-for-mobile-navigation-d12a87686efe) before, but haven't actually implemented the pattern into a lesson yet.

Your goal is to build a multi-page application that uses the Hamburger Menu icon to navigate between sections.

Your body copy can be Lorem Ipsum, but concentrate on applying appropriate CSS Transitions to accentuate your interface choices and interactivity.

## Requirements
* Make it responsive, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Follow the Webpack component and router architecture we've used on other labs. You can use `mkvanilla` as you set it up last lab to create this setup.
* Use the Hamburger Menu as your primary mobile navigation method.
* Implement CSS transforms, transitions, animations in a user-friendly way.
* Sketch your responsive layout **and** animation ideas before developing.

## Submission Instructions
Submit pull request URL in Canvas, and include a .zip of your sketches.
